// Quality and Efficiency

// Background:
// Real world problem solving is a complex field with multiple solutions and multiple
// trade-offs. Rarely are solutions perfect, but rather an optimization for a given perspective.
// If you google around you can find multiple frameworks for problem solving in relation to
// a field of work. Example: DMAIC

// For the problem below, you can choose to use any of the multitude of frameworks that
// exist, or make up your own, but you are not required to use one at all. There isn’t a right
// answer for the given problem. What does matter is the process by which you’ve drawn
// your conclusion. Be descriptive as possible on why you are making your choices.

// Setup:
// Every morning you must make a peanut butter sandwich, fresh apple juice, and crackers
// with cream cheese for your child’s lunch. Once all items are completed they must be
// placed in her backpack. You can only start making the items once she is up, you also
// aren’t sure when she’ll wake up since you aren’t responsible for waking her up and
// getting her ready. You have unlimited resources such as people to help make items,
// you’ll never be out of anything needed to make an item, etc. Your goal is to be done as
// fast as possible, because only then can you sit down and relax, maybe open a beer, it’s 7a,
// but who cares.

// Challenge:
// After weeks of doing this you discovered that even though you do the exact same thing
// every day, your results vary every day. Some days an item doesn’t make it into the
// backpack, some days you're done super fast, others you're late. Some days all the items
// make it in the backpack, but they aren’t completed - like a sandwich doesn’t have
// peanut butter on it, and some days everything is perfect.

// Objective:
// You’ve decided to start all over and rethink the morning process. Create and describe a
// new process.
